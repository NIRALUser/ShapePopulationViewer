ShapePopulationViewer
=====================

##What is it?

ShapePopulationViewer is a software that allows you to dynamically interact with multiple surfaces at the same time. It is very useful for visualisation and comparison of 3D surfaces by also displaying their scalars or vectors attributes stored in the points, and allowing the user to simply modify the colormap.
ShapePopulationViewer is available as an extension of [3D Slicer](http://www.slicer.org)
